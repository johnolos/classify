Some O
companies O
have O
been O
called O
economic O
traitors O
for O
seeking O
to O
lower O
their O
tax O
bills O
by O
moving O
overseas. O
But O
life O
insurers O
are O
accomplishing O
the O
same O
goal O
without O
leaving O
the O
country O
saving O
as O
much O
as O
$100 O
billion O
in O
federal O
taxes O
much O
of O
it O
in O
the O
last O
several O
years. O
The ORG
insurers O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
fierce O
competition O
for O
their O
business O
among O
states O
which O
have O
passed O
special O
laws O
that O
allow O
the O
companies O
to O
pull O
cash O
away O
from O
reserves O
they O
are O
required O
to O
keep O
to O
pay O
claims O
The O
insurers O
use O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
bonuses O
shareholder O
dividends O
acquisitions O
and O
other O
projects O
and O
because O
of O
complicated O
accounting O
maneuvers O
the O
money O
escapes O
federal O
taxation. O
The O
TransAmerica ORG

used O
a O

$1.8 O

while O
also O
avoiding O
an O

$640 O

according O

The O

was O
unusually O
large O
but O
otherwise O
followed O

South C

hot O
on O

the O
idea O

Hawaii C

itself O

the O
venue O

the O

appealing O

block O
the O

There O

The O

known O

all O

This O
march O
led O
by O
Mr. P
Sharpton P
— O
who O
has O
engaged O
in O
Ppetual O
protest O
over O
several O
decades O
— O
did O
not O
have O
some O
of O
the O
spontaneity O
of O
the O
social O
media-driven O
die-ins O
that O
have O
erupted O
around O
the O
country. O
Some O
here O
also O
complained O
of O
a O
commercial O
element. O
I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
were O
profiting O
off O
T-shirts, O
flags O
and O
hats, O
said O
Jay P
Bad P
Heart P
Bull P
36, O
who O
runs O
a O
nonprofit O
in O
Minneapolis. C
I O
even O
saw O
a O
dog O
with O
a O
shirt O
that O
said O
‘I O
can’t O
breathe.’ O
I O
respect O
the O
hustle, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
be O
it O
for O
a O
purpose. O
How O
does O
that O
help O
our O
community? O
Still, O
this O
march O
included O
the O
families O
of O
those O
now O
gone. O
My O
son O
was O
12, O
just O
a O
baby, O
said O
Samaria P
Rice, P
the O
mother O
of O
Tamir, P
who O
was O
shot O
to O
death O
in O
Cleveland C
after O
the O
police O
saw O
him O
with O
what O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
toy O
gun O
that O
fired O
plastic O
pellets. O
He O
is O
here O
with O
me O
and O
this O
is O
what O
he O
want O
me O
to O
do, O
she O
added. O
He O
had O
a O
promising O
future. O
All O
the O
families, O
we O
share O
the O
same O
pain. O
The O
police O
would O
not O
estimate O
how O
many O
marched O
in O
Washington, C
but O
at O
midday O
a O
plaza O
that O
could O
hold O
5,000 O
people O
had O
overflowed O
with O
demonstrators. O
As O
the O
march O
moved O
toward O
the O
Capitol, ORG
thousands O
more O
demonstrators O
poured O
in O
from O
side O
streets O
to O
form O
a O
mobile O
mass O
of O
puffy O
coats, O
strollers, O
posters O
and O
spontaneous O
prayer O
groups. O
I’m O
marching O
for O
everyone’s O
sons O
and O
daughters, O
said O
Esaw O
Garner, P
the O
widow O
of O
Eric P
Garner, P
who O
died O
on O
Staten P
Island C
when O
an O
officer O
placed O
him O
in O
a O
chokehold. O
The O
march O
follows O
recent O
protests O
around O
the O
country O
over O
recent O
grand O
jury O
decisions O
not O
to O
indict O
the O
officer O
who O
shot O
Mr. P

in O

the O
one O
who O
placed O
Mr. P

in O
a O
fatal O
hold O
in O
Staten P

Scores O
of O
protesters O
on O
Saturday T
came O
from O
Ferguson. P
On O
Friday, T
the O
death O
of O
Tamir P
Rice, P
the O
12-year-old O
Cleveland C
boy, O
was O
formally O
ruled O
a O
homicide, O
according O
to O
a O
county O
autopsy O
report; O
he O
died O
in O
November T
when O
an O
officer O
shot O
him O
within O
seconds O
of O
arriving O
on O
the O
scene. O
Protesters O
in O
recent O
weeks O
have O
occupied O
parks, O
city O
streets, O
train O
stations O
and O
retail O
stores O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
the O
use O
of O
force O
by O
the O
police. O
Thousands O
of O
people O
in O
New C
York C
tried O
to O
close O
major O
roads, O
bridges O
and O
tunnels, O
disrupting O
the O
rhythms O
of O
the O
city. O
In O
Berkeley, C
California, C
an O
Amtrak ORG
train O
was O
forced O
to O
stop, O
a O
central O
freeway O
was O
closed O
down O
for O
hours, O
and O
regional O
commuter O
trains O
were O
halted. O
For O
me O
to O
come O
out O
from O
my O
comfortable O
cocoon O
in O
this O
stage O
of O
my O
existence O
is O
something, O
said O
Cynthia P
Pace, P
a O
consultant O
in O
Baltimore C
who O
was O
marching O
on O
Saturday. T
We O
have O
enough O
money, O
our O
children O
are O
highly O
educated, O
all O
of O
these O
things. O
But O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
how O
we O
in O
the O
American O
public O
can O
see O
something O
on O
TV O
and O
12 O
people O
see O
it O
differently. O
There O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
this O
picture. O
The O
National ORG
Park C
Service ORG
said O
sponsors O
of O
Saturday’s T
march O
in O
Washington, C
which O
this O
year O
was O
called O
Justice O
for O
All, O
had O
sought O
a O
Pmit O
for O
5,000 O
protesters, O
but O
the O
crowd O
appeared O
quite O
a O
bit O
larger. O
Many O
protesters O
were O
organized O
by O
the O
American O
Civil O
Liberties ORG
Union, ORG
branches O
of O
the O
N.A.A.C.P. ORG
and O
various O
labor, O
civil O
rights O
and O
religious O
groups. O
Just O
steps O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
protest, O
senators O
worked O
to O
complete O
a O
budget O
bill O
and O
vote O
on O
other O
measures. O
I’m O
surprised O
to O
see O
so O
many O
ethnicities O
here O
today. O
It’s O
not O
just O
black O
people, O
like O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be. O
Mr. O
Sharpton P
followed O
several O
other O
speakers, O
invoking O
the O
history O
of O
the O
civil O
rights O
movement O
while O
calling O
on O
lawmakers O
to O
change O
how O
police O
shootings O
are O
investigated O
and O
adjudicated. O
We O
are O
here O
today O
because O
we O
must O
have O
this O
nation O
deal O
with O
the O
fact O
that, O
just O
like O
50 O
years O
ago, O
the O
state O
has O
taken O
the O
position O
to O
rob O
civil O
and O
human O
rights O
he O
said. O
Mr. P
Sharpton P
said O
that O
the O
Justice ORG
Department ORG
needed O
special O
funds O
and O
that O
special O
prosecutors O
must O
be O
appointed O
when O
civilians O
are O
killed O
by O
the O
police. O
Isabel P
Martes, P
42, O
a O
receptionist, O
drove O
to O
Washington C
from O
Harlem P
on O
Saturday T
morning O
with O
her O
sister. O
I O
have O
three O
sons O
and O
I O
have O
a O
husband, O
she O
said. O
Their O
lives O
matter. O
I’ve O
never O
been O
to O
a O
protest O
before, O
but O
things O
are O
getting O
out O
of O
control O
for O
our O
people O
so O
I O
needed O
to O
come. O
After O
today, O
I’ll O
be O
at O
more O
protests. O
I’m O
hopeful O
now, O
I’m O
hopeful. O
I’m O
happy O
to O
see O
so O
much O
unity. O
