Some O
companies O
have O
been O
called O
economic O
traitors O
for O
seeking O
to O
lower O
their O
tax O

But O
life O
insurers O
are O
accomplishing O
the O

goal O
without O
leaving O
the O
country O
saving O
as O
much O
as O
$100 O
billion O
in O
federal O
taxes O
much O
of O
it O
in O

The ORG
insurers O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
fierce O
competition O
for O
their O
business O
among O
states ORG
which O
have O
passed O
special O
laws O
that O
allow O
the O
companies O
to O
pull O
cash O
away O
from O
reserves O
they O
are O
required O
to O
keep O
to O
pay O
claims O
The O
insurers O
use O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
bonuses O
shareholder O
dividends O
acquisitions O
and O
other O
projects O
and O
because O
of O
complicated O

the O

The O

This O
march O
led O
by O
Mr. P
Sharpton P
— O
who O
has O
engaged O
in O
protest O
over O
several O
decades O
— O
did O
not O
have O
some O
of O
the O
spontaneity O
of O
the O
social O
media-driven O
die-ins O
that O
have O
erupted O
around O
the O
country. L
Some O
here O
also O
complained O
of O
a O
commercial O
element. O
I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
were O
profiting O
off O
T-shirts, O
flags O
and O
hats, O
said O
Jay P
Bad P
Heart P
Bull P
36, O
who O
runs O
a O

in O
Minneapolis. L
I O
even O
saw O
a O
dog O
with O
a O
shirt O
that O
said O
‘I O
can’t O
breathe.’ O
I O
respect O
the O
hustle, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
be O
it O
for O
a O
purpose. O
How O
does O
that O
help O
our O
community? O
Still, O
this O
march O
included O
the O
families O
of O
those O
now O
gone. O
My O
son O
was O
12, O
just O
a O
baby, O
said O
Samaria P
Rice, P
the O
mother O
of O
Tamir, P
who O
was O
shot O
to O
death O
in O
Cleveland L
after O
the O
police O
saw O
him O
with O
what O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O

that O
fired O
plastic O
pellets. O
He O
is O
here O
with O
me O
and O
this O
is O
what O
he O
want O
me O
to O
do, O
she O
added. O
He O
had O
a O
promising O
future. O
All O
the O
families, O
we O
share O
the O
same O
pain. O
The O
police O
would O
not O
estimate O
how O
many O
marched O
in O
Washington, L
but O
at O
midday O
a O
plaza O
that O
could O
hold O
5,000 O
people O
had O
overflowed O
with O
demonstrators. O
As O
the O
march O
moved O
toward O
the O
Capitol, L
thousands O
more O

poured O
in O
from O

streets O
to O

a O

mass O
