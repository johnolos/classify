Mr P

the O

oil O
and O

industry O
following O
by O
the O

but O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
tax O
cuts O
for O
oil O
companies O
he O
announced O
last O

would O
help O

New O
rules O
to O
bind O
the O
profligacy O
of O
future O
governments O
have O
been O
unveiled O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
balance O
the O
Government’s ORG
books O
by O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
next O
parliament. O
An O
update O
to O
the O
Charter O
of O
Budget O
Responsibility O
would O
require O
future O
Governments ORG
to O
make O
plans O
to O
balance O
the O
cyclically-adjusted O
current O
budget O
deficit O
within O
a O
three-year O
horizon. O
The O
change O
would O
tighten O
up O
the O
charter O
first O
introduced O
in O
2010, T
which O
required O
the O
Government ORG
to O
balance O
the O
budget O
over O
a O
rolling O
five-year O
period. O
According O
to O
Government ORG
estimates, O
£30bn O
of O
further O
consolidation O
– O
either O
cuts O
or O
raised O
taxation O
– O
will O
be O
required O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
2017-18 T
fiscal O
year O
to O
meet O
the O
new O
target O
and O
eliminate O
the O
deficit. O
Achieving O
this O
will O
require O
further O
difficult O
decisions O
to O
be O
made O
by O
Government, ORG
the O
Treasury ORG
said. O
As O
a O
percentage O
of O
GDP, O
public O
sector O
net O
borrowing O
has O
fallen O
by O
over O
a O
third O
since O
the O
2009-10 T
fiscal O
year. O
Government ORG
projections O
suggest O
it O
well O
have O
fallen O
by O
half O
by O
the O
